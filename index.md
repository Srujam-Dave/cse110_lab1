**Hello!** This is a markdown page explaining a little bit about me as a programmer. In the words of a wise man: 

> This page is awesome
* *Me, right now*

Here's an example of a piece of code I've written: 

```
print("Hello World!")
```

Here are the classes I'm taking this quarter:
- CSE 110
- CSE 101
- CSE 141
- CSE 141L
- CCE 3

I'm writing this assignment for CSE 110, which is a class with the following goals:
1. Introduce students to the concepts of software engineering.
2. Help students learn about the collaborative and social aspects of software engineering.
3. Help students unlearn bad habits that they picked up in other parts of their programming education

I have the following homework every week:
- [x] Writing assignments for CCE 3
- [x] Labs for CSE 110
- [ ] PrarieLearn Quizzes for CSE 141
- [x] Worksheets for CSE 101
- [ ] Labs for CSE 141L

Here's an example of some of the lab's I've worked on for CSE 110.
